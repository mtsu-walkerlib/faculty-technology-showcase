### Description

The Walker Library is planning an event to profile data science in teaching and research across the university. This event will be called “Engage with Data Science” and will take place in the Walker Library on Tuesday, September 24, 2019 from 3-6 pm. 

Data science is a quickly evolving interdisciplinary field that is becoming an essential component of the curriculum and includes high-impact pedagogies like problem-based and projet-based learning.  According to an MTSU survey of students conducted in October 2018, there is significant interest studying data science. The ‘Engage with Data Science” event will seek to allow all MTSU students to become more aware of the what data science is and connect with faculty across the disciplines. Students and faculty will learn about Walker Library’s support for data discovery, use, and management. The student reach for this event will be campus-wide. 

The ‘Engage with Data Science” event will have three components:
-	4-6 tables in the Library Atrium where students and faculty in multiple disciplines will display and discuss data science projects in teaching and research. 
-	Workshop sessions where faculty and students demonstrate tools, skills, and outcomes of data science work. Students will be involved in the programming.
-	An area for refreshments and networking. Faculty will be encouraged to be available in the refreshments area to engage with students who are interested in learning more about data science.

We are seeking participation from departments to promote their programs at tables in the Library Atrium during the event. We are seeking participation from faculty members to give 20-25 minute workshop session on data science tools and skills. Contact Mary Ellen Sloane
